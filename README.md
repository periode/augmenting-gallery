## Course Description

Wall labels, audio guides, and informative maps are just some of the ways by which galleries and museums attempt at archiving and sharing culture in its broadest understanding. Given the changing role of museums and galleries in the 21st century, how can we utilize digital technologies to design and deliver experiences that extend our concept of an exhibit, and to assist us in cultural transmission? How can such tools do so without distracting from the power and importance of a collection of artworks, or by purposefully challenging problematic aspects such as an exhibitâ€™s disputed provenance or ethical concerns? And how can these tools make collections more accessible to a wider audience?

This course mobilizes resources from media studies, museography, art history, sociology, interaction design and web design and development to answer these questions. Topics covered include exhibition installation and curation, design and development in the React web framework for mobile development. The course is open to students from a variety of academic backgrounds interested in gaining hands-on experience in applying new technologies to virtual exhibitions and cultural heritage.
