<p>think of an example of a <em>good</em> interaction, and a <em>bad</em> interaction (with a software system, not a human!).</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Interaction is when you do something to someone?</p>
<p>Interaction is when something <em>acknowledges</em> an action?</p>
<p>Interaction is when you <em>initiate</em> something and get something <em>back</em>? What do you get back? An action, an information, a feeling?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">models of interaction</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>a good interaction is an <strong>exchange</strong> between two or more agents (possibly conscious agents), in which <em>the result is greater than the sum of its parts</em>.</p>
<p>(i.e. what has been accomplished could not have been done by only one of the interactors)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>In <a target='_blank' href="https://nostarch.com/interactive.htm">The Art of Interactive Design</a>, Chris Crawford defines an interaction as a <strong>conversation</strong>, between multiple agents who, one after the other, &quot;listen, think, and speak&quot;, which in computer terms, would consist of &quot;input, process, output&quot;.</p>
<p>The richness of an interaction comes from the care in the listening experience (&quot;is everything that is being said, being heard?&quot; -think of non-verbal cues), to the depth in processing (&quot;what is it that is really being meant, and how can I extract that meaning to serve as the basis for my response?&quot;) to the quality and clarity of the output (&quot;is what I&#39;m saying clearly reflecting the results of my thought process? does it leave room for further exchange?&quot;)</p>
<p>Whatever the response/output is, it&#39;s always important to <em>leave room for further action</em>. Even when an error happens, the handling of the error should be done &quot;gracefully&quot; (e.g. &quot;This operation did not succeed. Would you like to try again? Or try a different operation?)</p>
<hr>
<p>some of the requirements for interaction include:</p>
<ul>
<li>being able to communicate exactly what you intend,</li>
<li>having an equal interest in both parties,</li>
<li>having a common factor, common references,</li>
<li>being able to receive information,</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>links -&gt; recommendations or suggestions</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">elements of interaction</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>how many elements needed for an interaction can you identify?</p>
<ul>
<li>a designer</li>
<li>a system represents the <em>problem-domain</em></li>
<li>a user (students, graduate students, parents, alumni, faculty (advisors), staff (registrar, bursar), external people in general, employers)</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>how do these relate to janet murray&#39;s components of interaction — <strong>interactor</strong>, <strong>information</strong>, <strong>agency</strong>, <strong>transparence</strong> ?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Most interactive systems include: the developer, the system and the user.</p>
<p>In terms of the <strong>interactor</strong>, it&#39;s a significant switch from user: user means passive, while interactor means active. Just because one is on the final, receiving end of an event (even if it&#39;s an interactive event), doesn&#39;t mean that they do not re-appropriate the event for themselves, and engage with it in non-expected ways. There is a thin line between making a system error-proof (making sure the interactor doesn&#39;t break the system by inputting the wrong data), and making the system fool-proof (making sure the interactor doesn&#39;t do anything too complicated because the assumption is that the interactor can&#39;t know as well as the designer).</p>
<p>The concept of <strong>agency</strong> is tied to the second meaning: an interactive system should <em>enable</em> its interactor, allowing them to do as much as they would like to do, as much as they can imagine, and perhaps even more. A good example of such a thing is the LEGO brick. A system which provides agency is <strong>a system which makes you responsible for what you want to be responsible for</strong>. On the opposite, a system like an automatic slide door doesn&#39;t provide much agency: it&#39;s either fully open or fully closed, and doesn&#39;t exactly tell you what is need for either of these states to change.</p>
<p>The need for <strong>transparency</strong> in interactive systems comes from this similar idea. Thinking that a system is intuitive relies on a particular number of <strong>assumptions</strong>: you already know shortcuts, design heuristics, patterns and processes. A transparent system, on the other side, is a system which exposes itself to the interactor, and only assumes that she would be able to make sense of it, given a good interface. Robert Henke&#39;s <a target='_blank' href="http://www.roberthenke.de/concerts/cbm8032av.html">CBM8032</a> is a good example of the things someone can do if they&#39;re given access to all the <em>relevant</em> parts of a system.</p>
<p>Additionally, interfaces on desktop between Mac, Linux and Windows assume very different behaviours of their users by showing them different amounts of information</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">interactive media vs. digital media vs. new media?</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>what makes a computer different in its interactivity?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/joe2.jpg" alt="joe2.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The computer can &quot;think&quot;. That is, it can act and respond somewhat dynamically and contextually. If the programmers can think through the possible future situations that the computer will be confronted with, it will give the impression that the interactor is having a &quot;smart&quot; conversation with the system.</p>
<p>In short, digital media is different from other media in that <strong>it can reconfigure itself as it goes</strong>. The problem, as we&#39;ve seen with Licklider the previous week, is that thinking through possible problems in advance turns out to be more complicated than expected. So the answer at this point is either to establish the digital product you have as either close-ended or open-ended. Close-ended means that you are not providing anything beyond the basics of the product can do: the scope is tight, the interactions safe, and the &quot;world&quot; narrow. On the other side, open-ended means that you leave some room for interpretation to the interactor. It might not be as rigorous—in the scientific sense of the term—but it will provide a different kind of engagement, by involving the interactor deeper into the meaning of what she is presented with. Open-ended systems involve some kind of <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Figure-Ground_Organization">gestalt</a> (the whole is greater than the sum of its parts).</p>
<p>The image above exposes a kind of open-ended system: Joseph Weizenbaum developed a program called <a target='_blank' href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/linguist238/p36-weizenabaum.pdf">ELIZA</a>, a chatbot which would essentially &quot;bounce back&quot; questions that the interactor would input. For instance, if you would type &quot;I&#39;m unhappy&quot;, ELIZA would respond &quot;Why are you unhappy?&quot;. While the computer program has no idea of what &quot;unhappiness&quot; is, the interaction still elicits interesting thoughts in the interactor&#39;s mind.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the specificity of media</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>how does a medium affect a particular message?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/mcluhan.jpeg" alt="mcluhan.jpeg"></div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>sender &lt;- --- medium ----&gt; receiver</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The guy in the picture right there is Marshall McLuhan, who in his books <a target='_blank' href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-media">Understanding Media</a> started the field of <em>media studies</em>.</p>
<p>It makes things more or less difficult to say in particular mediums. While there is no &quot;true&quot;, &quot;actual&quot; limit to what can be said in a particular way, it&#39;s a lot easier to work in the field of classical Western philosophy when you have a pen and a paper than when you can only broadcast smoke signals.</p>
<p>It also affects what <strong>receivers</strong> pay attention to. The predominance of a particular sense might be hard to overcome (and therefore should be taken into account), when a message is being received.</p>
<p>A newer medium also develops <em>on top</em> of previous media, in a phenomenon called <strong>remediation</strong> (writing integrates parts of speech, photography integrate parts of drawing, cinema integrates parts of photography, etc.)</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">dimensions of digital media</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>-&gt; spatial</p>
<p>-&gt; procedural</p>
<p>-&gt; encyclopedic</p>
<p>-&gt; participatory</p>
<p>(first developed in <a target='_blank' href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck">hamlet on the holodeck</a>)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The <strong>spatial</strong> component comes from this possibility of navigation, of going from one <em>place</em> to another. There are locations (websites), pathways (hyperlinks), landmarks (icons) which allow us to both <strong>explore</strong> and <strong>keep track of where we are</strong>. How do we make sure that the interactor never feels lost?</p>
<p>The <strong>procedural</strong> component relies on the fact that we are dealing specifically with <strong>digital</strong> media. Through a computer, it becomes possible to set up rules, procedures, in order to allow for everything else (space, encyclopedia, participation).</p>
<p>The <strong>encyclopedic</strong> component is the consequence of working with networked media. If one is connected to the Internet, there is no pre-existing reason as to why one shouldn&#39;t be able to access any information that is on the Internet. A good example of that is Assassin&#39;s Creed&#39;s <a target='_blank' href="https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tech-gaming/assassins-creed-origins-discovery-tour-shows-how-video-games-could-be-an-education-gamechanger-a3663966.html">Discovery Mode</a> through which you walk around the game world and learn of the &quot;real world&quot; equivalent of what you&#39;re seeing.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">interactive digital media</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>interactive digital media can create <strong>conversations</strong> with whole <strong>worlds</strong>, allowing for the <strong>co-construction</strong> of meaning.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>So, as we start developing interactive experiences within the context of museums, it&#39;s important to keep in mind those things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you enabling an interesting conversation? How responsive and predictive is your system. For instance, if the visitor takes one action (view an object up close), then would be the next action (e.g. viewing other objects? viewing advanced information related to the same object?)</li>
<li>What kind of world are you creating? What are its multiple components, and where do you put the emphasis? Is it a social world, an economic world, a world connected to other worlds, etc.?</li>
<li>How is meaning co-constructed? How do you let the visitor explore them in more details, at their own pace, in their own way? And to what extent do you ensure that all visitors get the same amount of knowledge, and each visitor gets their own version?</li>
</ul>

<p><a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ujlefWcY-w">live-taped corridor</a></p>
<p><a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcaaVZrUC44">the other: rest energy</a></p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>In Bruce Nauman&#39;s piece, Live-Taped Corridor, we can identify two obvious main components: the interactor (the person holding the phone in the video) and the system (comprised of the two monitors, the CCTV camera, and the corridor itself).</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to think of the system itself as made up of smaller components, yet the CCTV acts as an input receiver (filming the corridor), the monitors act as the output medium (showing the video), and the corridor itself acts as a scenography, making sure that the interactor enters the system in the &quot;correct&quot; way. Finally, the third component is <strong>the artist</strong>, or the designer, the person who set up the whole system and whose presence is like a ghost, or an angel, hovering above the piece while remaining transparent and barely visible.</p>
<p>How does a ceremony express importance? How does the way to greet someone in different cultures express particular aspects of those cultures?</p>
<p>How can we tell whether a space is &quot;safe&quot; or not? To what extent does it have to do with the layout of some specific rules? (e.g. codes of conduct?)</p>
<p>This particular piece, by Marina Abramovic and Ulay (1980) works as an artwork since it does ask broader questions from a simple interaction: trust, balance, relationship, etc.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">expressing and persuading</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>how do you persuade someone of something?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>verbal rhetoric: using words to convince</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>&quot;<em>the act we are about to accomplish is as beautiful as a rose, as beautiful as an eiffel tower besieged at dawn.</em>&quot; - christiane taubira, french minister of justice, presenting the same-sex law.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>with images</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/parr_india_goa.jpg" alt="parr_india_goa.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Rhetoric uses logic and (verbal) grammar to get its point across. However, there are other kinds of rhetoric, particularly visual rhetoric and procedural rhetoric. You can make <strong>logical</strong> connections, <strong>emotional</strong> connections, and <strong>aesthetic</strong> connections.</p>
<p>Kenneth Burke&#39;s version is: &quot;the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols&quot;.</p>
<p>Christiane Taubira: &quot;the act we are about to accomplish is as beautiful as a rose, as an eiffel tower besieged at dawn.&quot;. This particular quote is powerful because of the linguistic tricks it uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>using the symbol of the rose both as beauty and as the symbol of the socialist party</li>
<li>quoting from a french-guyanese poet (Léon Gontran Damas), a black MP whom had to endure adversities in order to sit in Parliament.</li>
<li>referring to the Eiffel Tower as France (implying that all of France wants same-sex marriage)</li>
<li>referring to the Eiffel Tower being besieged, implying that the conservative party is attacking France by rebuking the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, Barack Obama&#39;s speech in 2008 in New Hampshire: &quot;Yes we can.</p>
<p>It was the call of workers who organized; women who reached for the ballot; a President who chose the moon as our new frontier; and a King who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the Promised Land.&quot;</p>
<p>This speech made the subtle connection between the US-American people and the Jews of Israel by mentioning the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Finally, rhetoric can also be visual: this cover is taken from an example in <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythologies_(book)">Mythologies</a>, a book about the significance of cultural objects. In it, the cover is analyzed as a system of visual signs re-enforcing the colonial vision of the colonized people as a cute child who looks up (implying inferiority) to an idea of France, while pledging allegiance, in a uniform halfway between boy-scouts and military.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">expressing with procedures</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>how do we express things with rules?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>An example is the Universal Declarations of Human Rights. There are a set of values, a particular worldview which wants to be expressed by the UN, and such a worldview is going to be realized through <strong>rules</strong>, through what one can or cannot do.</p>
<p>Other legal systems assume different things about the world, and use rules to solidify these worldviews (e.g. the U.S. Supreme Court granting the same rights to companies as to individuals, interpretations of Sharia law prescribing a bigger share of inheritance to first-born sons over mothers.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">a word on games</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>could everything be a game?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/Homo Ludens eng.jpg" alt="Homo Ludens eng.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Arguably, everything could be seen as a game. Johan Huizinga&#39;s argument in his book <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Ludens">Homo Ludens</a> is that, since play isn&#39;t restricted to humans, then play actually predates civilization. Is it then possible to think of all civilization as an elaborate game?</p>
<p>If everything has goals and rules, we can think of the U.S. Constitution as the goal of &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; and the rules as the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>In terms of games mimicking real systems, it is interesting to point out the case of <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord%27s_Game">The Landlord&#39;s Game</a>, a board game originally designed to educate the masses about the evils of real-estate capitalism (i.e. winner-takes-all, others are ruined). The game was then the inspiration of Monopoly, a crude apology of land-grabbing practices.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>User Experience is comprised of <em>touch points</em>, of particular moments in which the public comes into contact with the product. For instance, the moment that someone books a ticket online for a museum, the moment someone enters the museum and goes through security check, the moment someone asks for directions at the information kiosk, etc. And how all of these come together in a coherent moment.</p>
<p>On the other side, User Interface is the collection of specific graphical elements which help create a <em>metaphor</em> for the interactor to understand how to manipulate and communicate with such a system.</p>
<p>In other words, UI is what we see, and UX is how we feel when we use something (the overarching ceremonial), and how we feel when we&#39;re done using it.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the problem</h3><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>we need to make our product/artefact/app <em>usable</em>, with the lowest cognitive friction, and the highest reliable output.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>User interfaces are indeed a metaphor, either building on previous knowledge by the interactors (e.g the Trash on a desktop isn&#39;t really a trash, but it does the same thing as a trash does), or by developing new habits (the <a target='_blank' href="https://blog.placeit.net/history-of-the-hamburger-icon/">hamburger icon</a> ).</p>
<p>The point of a good UI is to have itself be forgotten. It should be as invisible as possible, while at the same time being &quot;obvious&quot;. This pinnacle of obviousness was reached in Apple products, particularly with the iPod and the iPhone, which <em>didn&#39;t come with a user manual!</em></p>

One of the predominant of these is User-Centered Design, which starts from the development of a fictional &quot;user&quot; and designs the system around the wants and needs of that user.</p>
<p>One of the most important practices of user-centered design is <strong>usability testing</strong>, the constant process of making sure that whatever stage of the development process you are at, a given user can still navigate, interact, and understand what is going on!</p>
<p>While this is a better approach that a purely one-way perspective (design the system, and the provide the interface), one of the pitfalls might be that the fictional user whom serves as a base for this design might not actually exist! There is a huge difference between an ideal user and the diversity of individual in practice, and that is something that all designers should remain aware of.</p>

<p>In order to apply an image to an object, you need to create a <code>Material</code> (<code>Assets &gt; Create &gt; Material</code>).</p>

What a raycast does is that, given a point on a screen, and a description of the 3D world, it can figure out what its path in the 3D world will be: is it going to hit something? at which angle? how should the thing that it hits look like? if it's a ray of light, should the object become brighter? if it's a a ray of light blocked by another object, should it make the object behind darker?

For our purposes, it allows us to translate between 2D space (the screen) to 3D space (the world).</div></div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">creating game objects</h3><div class="prep" concept="7"><p>We want to be able to create Game Objects while our app is running!
