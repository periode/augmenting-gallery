The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a &#39;hakubutsukan&#39;, a &#39;house of extensive things&#39; – this would eventually become accepted as the equivalent word for &#39;museum&#39; in Japan and China.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>why do we even put seemingly disparate objects together in a special building?</p>

</div><div class="prep" concept="1"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"></div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">defining culture</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p><em>the set of visible and invisible relations between individuals of a similar group, as expressed through possessions, actions, location, speech, etc., in order to create and sustain a shared meaning</em></p>
<p>aka practicing a collective dream</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Culture can be approached in multiple ways: culture as the coherent element of a group (&quot;youth culture&quot;) but also as the defining markers between different groups (&quot;high-brow&quot; vs. &quot;low-brow&quot; cultures).</p>
<p>As the object of study of fields like anthropology (study of humans and human behavior, in particular through their meaning-making practices) or sociology (study of the patterns of social interactions), culture is diffused across all components of a social group, and therefore more elusive than the specific representations of, say, religion, politics or the arts. Culture is the web which underpins such other fields of action.</p>
<p>Knowing about culture allows us to know more about ourselves; once we&#39;ve highlighted some findings, or some interesting things about culture, communicating it through digital media, as an information delivery medium, can help us achieve that goal.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">cultural vs. natural</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>what is the difference between something artificial and something natural?</p>
<p>natural parks exist because humans sustain them</p>
<p>face filters become a common vocabulary and social practice</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The difference is, no pun intended, artificial. It can be argued that everything that humans touch become artificial (including dog breeds, forests, mountains), while the denomination of &quot;the natural&quot; is a label applied to certain things which we imagine to be normal, untouched, like a &quot;natural&quot; park.</p>
<p>The point of approaching our environment as artificial (i.e. human-made, or human-modified) is that it unlocks a set of questions as to <em>why</em> humans have created, or appropriated this particular object. What makes it important? What does it represent for the group of humans concerned with it? On how many different &quot;levels&quot; does it operate?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">cultural studies</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>cultural studies is a field that studies cultural production and consumption in order to study the systems of power within a given group of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>airpods (meme culture around affordability)</li>
<li>iphone (status symbol, effortless, camera, democratic photography, western world,)</li>
<li>maccha latte (young person with a lot of time to chill in cafes) / avocado toasts</li>
<li>brunch (sunday ritual, replaced the church?)</li>
<li>qr codes (link to anything else, personal ID, befriending on wechat, efficient transactions, homogeneity of the financial, dematerialization)</li>
<li>masks (new social role, political statement, freedom of doing whatever you want,  safety, global mass production and re-localization)</li>
<li>payment terminals</li>
<li>lime scooters (ownership -&gt; access)</li>
<li>robots (meal-delivery, care, relationships) - looks like a human</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Cultural studies doesn&#39;t just look at culture just to explore what is going on (descriptive) but to give reasons as to why that must be going on (explicative). What do cultural practices (i.e. practices of meaning-making between humans) tell us about how those humans are organized? About what matters to them? About how they see the world.</p>
<p>Particularly, cultural studies scholars such as Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams were interested in the class structures and systems of power as they manifest themselves not through explicit modes of constraint (like Foucault&#39;s investigation of disciplinary systems), or through quantitative methods (like Bourdieu&#39;s field study techniques), but through implicit, yet evocative practices. For example, how does how one set the table represent one&#39;s socio-economic belonging, or aspirations? How does one&#39;s leisure activities act as someone&#39;s desire to fit within a group? How could those activities be imposed, to an extent, upon those who practice them?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">museums as cultural institutions</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>so what kind of culture do museums present?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Museums tend to develop both <strong>for</strong> cultural practices and <strong>as</strong> cultural practices. On the one hand, museums document, present and highlight aspects of different cultures (across time and/or space), and therefore have a responsibility in conveying a &quot;<em>truth</em>&quot; about the collections and the objects they are presenting.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, they also act <strong>as</strong> culture, and in that they are the object of a cultural practice (e.g. going to the museum on sundays). In that sense, the museums themselves become representative of our culture.</p>

</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Objects are first and foremost materials: they can be seen, touched, heard, smelled, before they can be understood. Through this materiality, objects embody more invisible, evanescent, sometimes &quot;ideological&quot; relationships and therefore act as testimonies to our culture.</p>
<p>Objects can have a range of sizes, from a toothpick to the sixth continent of plastic (often qualifying as <a target='_blank' href="http://www.cyborganthropology.com/Hyperobjects">hyperobjects</a>)</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">objects and culture</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>&quot;<em>artefacts are a means by which we give form to, and come to an understanding of, ourselves, others</em>&quot; -daniel miller</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Daniel Miller is an anthropologist, and aims at highlighting the need for <em>all</em> societies to look at their objects as essential cultural artefacts, playing complex roles of function and signification between all of us; as a result, he doubts the usefulness of making a clear disctinction between <em>humans</em> and <em>objects</em>. More recently, he&#39;s been leading a research project on digital anthropology: <a target='_blank' href="https://www.uclpress.co.uk/collections/series-why-we-post">why we post</a></p>
<p>Particularly, artefacts (as Miller calls them) are means of representing not just individuals (through their choice of using those) but mostly as manifestations of the historical and geographical contexts in which they operate. This isn&#39;t just limited to the, say, masks of &quot;primitive&quot; populations studied by anthropologists such as a Marcel Mauss and Levi-Strauss, but to all objects created by any society, including (and especially!) societies from which anthropologists typically come from.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">ordering</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>the way we classify things gives them a particular kind of meaning.</p>
<p><strong>structuralism</strong> is an approach in which all things, peoples and relationships happen within one <em>defined</em> overarching structure, a cultural project with existing rules (either explicit or implicit).</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Ordering things gives them meaning in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>it applies a label, and therefore creates a connection between a word and an object, which is powerful in itself (e.g. labeling a <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=to4m1zu7x5g">song from fairuz</a> as &quot;world music&quot;)</li>
<li>it also puts an object in a relationship with other objects, creating an implicit connection between them (e.g. think of having to buy shampoo in the kitchen cleaning section of the supermarket)</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to see these orderings of things is through ideology, which is a set of imagined relationships giving an explanation for the reality of our lives.</p>
<p>Another is through structuralism, a current started by <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure">Ferdinand de Saussure</a> and his work on linguistics, and by represented best by <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_L%C3%A9vi-Strauss">Claude Lévi-Strauss</a>. Both of these academics attempted to find the <em>abstract logic</em> present behind the relationships of humans and objects, and always bring them back to those abstract, immutable laws (also cf. Noam Chomsky&#39;s work on generative grammar).</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">being ordered</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>on the other hand, being ordered means that objects act as a classification systems for humans.</p>
<p>essentially, objects help humans represent themselves.</p>

</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>three moments in meaning-making:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>production</strong> (where and when was it made? by whom?)</li>
<li><strong>mediation</strong> (how does it present itself to its audience? what words and images are being used to represent it?)</li>
<li><strong>consumption</strong> (how is it actually used? how is that use congruent with the intended use?)</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>There are actually a couple of other moments, according to Paul DuGay and his co-authors of <em>Doing Cultural Studies</em>. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>representation (how is the object shown to us? both by its creators, and by others?)</li>
<li>identity (what are the traits that are associated with the object, beyond what the creators want to have explicitly presented?)</li>
<li>production (in a very marxist sense: what are the practical conditions of the creation of the object, and how do those relate to broader ideological conditions?)</li>
<li>consumption (how do people actually engage with it?)</li>
<li>regulation (under what circumstances is the object allowed or not? by which legal/moral system?)</li>
</ul>
<p>A different approach is that of <em>culture</em>, <em>media</em> and <em>identity</em>.</p>

<p><strong><a target='_blank' href="https://developers.google.com/ar/">ARCore</a></strong>, made by Google, still catches up to apple&#39;s features, but addresses a lot more devices.</p>
<p><strong><a target='_blank' href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@1.0/manual/index.html#using-ar-foundation">ARFoundation</a></strong> is Unity&#39;s answer to both, allowing us to develop in one framework, and indiscriminately target ARKit or ARCore</p>
<p>finally, <strong><a target='_blank' href="https://www.ptc.com/en/products/augmented-reality/vuforia">Vuforia</a></strong> is the &quot;ancestor&quot; of contemporary AR, having been around for a bit longer, and a lot more reliable/stable, while not offering all the features of ARKit or ARCore.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="4"><p>All of the above rely on a field of computer science called Computer Vision (a series of math operations being applied to an image in order to extract its features), and particularly aim at recognizing <strong>feature points</strong>, which are points in an image which can be kept track of, in order to build up spatial awareness of what is being looked at. These feature points are essential, and this is why you might not see good AR results if you are only, say, looking at a dark, flat surface with no reflections (e.g. <code>the void</code>)</p>
<p>How these feature points are implemented differ slightly between libraries and software solutions, mostly based on funding of the teams and market demand: in the end, they all do the same thing!</p>

<p><code>ARSession</code> has the responsibility to start, save, restart, recall and close AR Sessions. it takes care of a lot of the nitty gritty that we don&#39;t particularly want to deal with. </p>

<p>To <strong>interact</strong> with the world, we need to use the special Racyast manager provided by ARFoundation, and which is located on the <code>ARSession</code> component. Which results in a code like:</p>
<pre><code>GameObject go = GameObject.Find(&quot;AR Session&quot;);
go.GetComponent&lt;ARSession&gt;().Raycast(Input.GetTouch(0).position, etc.);</code></pre></div><div class="prep" concept="4"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="4"><div>Details on how to set up a basic scene in AR Foundation can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@1.0/manual/index.html#using-ar-foundation).

<p>In order to register those, one of the two colliding objects need to have a <code>Rigidbody</code>.</p>

//-- when we create a gameobject, we can store it in a variable

<p>In order to create a prefab, create a new <code>GameObject</code> in the <code>Hierarchy</code>, and then drag it into the <code>Assets</code> panel. You will see it become blue in the <code>Hierarchy</code>, and you can now create as many copies as you want of this <code>Prefab</code>.</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when you want to instantiate objects at runtime, without having them in your scene to start with.</p>
