<p>connections and collections: does the painting relate to something or does it relate to itself?</p>
<p>a lot of paintings emphasize the gallery as a space, while a single painting makes the gallery disappear</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/gallery_modernism.JPG" alt="gallery_modernism.JPG"></div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/installation_shot.jpg" alt="installation_shot.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Originally, the difference between the museum and the gallery didn&#39;t exist. It is with the emergence of the bourgeois class, with enough money to comission and purchase artworks that the gallery, an independent space without historical, royal or political credentials, started to open.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that &quot;traditional&quot; galleries (i.e., museums) did not always, and still do not, indulge into what we see today as the &quot;white cube&quot;.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">modernism</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>modernism is a new version of &quot;art for art&#39;s sake&quot;, with clemens greenberg at the forefront.</p>
<p>an artwork is <em>autotelic</em> if it only refers to itself.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/mondrian.jpg" alt="mondrian.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>This is accompanied by, at the turn of the twentieth century, the emergence of <strong>modernism</strong>. Parts of modernism, particularly abstractionism is more of a theoretical component, and this implies that the space the art is shown in should be first and foremost dedicated to the unique appreciation of art for art itself.</p>
<p>This piece by Piet Mondrian is an example of the focus on &quot;painting as a series of colored brushstrokes&quot; rather than &quot;painting as representing something&quot;. The consequence of such a shift to modernism has led the art world at the time to think about the ideal situation in which to appreciate art, a situation in which nothing disturbs the viewer.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the art market</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the shift starts at the end of the 19th century, as artists start exhibiting works with private dealers.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/durandruel.jpg" alt="durandruel.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>In the mid-eighteenth century, artists started to move away from traditional &quot;Salons&quot; or fine art academies, to display their work in different circles. As art dealers appear (this guy here is one of the first ones, Durand-Ruel in France), the collection of these commodities influence how we view them (i.e. &quot;the hype&quot; of the artist).</p>
<p>The organization of exhibition in that context (i.e. disregarding the scientific rigor of museums), has also led to a clear &quot;instrumentalization&quot; of art by the galleries (and perhaps even by government, as the CIA did with the abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock).</p>
<p>This leads to the trend in which, while museums don&#39;t want to get involved with contemporary production (they still do get involved with contemporary discussions), art galleries are very happy to make or break artists, which then are consecrated in retrospective exhibitions in museums.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the curator</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>acts as the <strong>maker of meaning</strong>, along with the collector, the dealer and the critic.</p>
<ul>
<li>visual scenography</li>
<li>where to place the art pieces (-&gt; grouping of pieces)</li>
<li>which art pieces to show and which not to show</li>
<li>what is there to say about them</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>This rise of the commercial art gallery also means that there is a new need for organizing shows, for exhibition-making. This figure of the curator becomes in charge of the narrative given to the works, of how we understand it.</p>
<p>There is also a tension between the &quot;art for itself&quot; and the two roles that emerge: curator and critic. On the one hand, the work is &quot;self-explanatory&quot;, on the other hand, it needs to be justified by people in order to fit within the canon of already accepted artworks. This is going to affect how we see and use &quot;peripheral media&quot; in museums and galleries.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">private museums</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>private foundations are behaving more and more like museums, while keeping an active influence on the art market.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/freeingarchitecture.jpg" alt="freeingarchitecture.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>So the state of things now is that of a highly influenced art world by the commercial structures that are set up to exchange art for monetary value, and are therefore not bound to &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;heritage&quot; or &quot;education&quot;, as more classical museum institutions are.</p>
<p>Particularly, the emergence of incredibly large galleries (e.g. Gagosian, David Zwirner), as well as international art fairs (Basel, Paris Biennale, Frieze), both enable and stifle innovation, the same way that a capitalistic market favors both outsiders and monopolies.</p>
<p>This picture here is Junya Ishigami&#39;s show <em>Freeing Architecture</em>, which is the manifestation of one of these (well-deserved, in my opinion) hypes over an artist (accompanying his construction of the Serpentine pavillion).</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">reconnecting to the public?</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>are galleries more in touch than museums with their audience?</p>

</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/whitecube.jpg" alt="whitecube.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>While art galleries affect the production of art through market dynamics, the very architecture of the gallery space, moving away from the red velvet of institutional fine arts academies, and towards a more minimal approach, emphasizing nothing but the form of the artwork.</p>
<p>This direct consequence of modernism&#39;s &quot;art of art&#39;s sake&quot; approach is that it required a space in which it can be contemplated without disturbance. The white cube gallery therefore becomes the sacred, sanitized space in which the only thing that matters is looking at art.</p>
<p>However, this environment quickly turned into a constraint for artists at the time (starting around the second world war), which then tried to move away from the restraint of whiteness.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">seeing art</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>this setup implies that the only thing that matters in art is <strong>seeing</strong></p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The eye becomes something that is both personal (vision is subjective, individual) and at the same time de-humanizing (it is the only sense, the only part of the body that is allowed to be activated). As they say in museums, &quot;you touch with your eyes&quot;.</p>
<p>This focus on a limited (if dominant) aspect of the human senses suffered a push back as artists started to create works that would take into account the situation, the body, and the thoughts of the audience.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">room to play with</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>breaking away from the restriction of the blank space, the installation comes to life.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Parallel to the development of the white cube, comes the installation. Since the gallery becomes a sacred space exclusively devoted to art, then it actually follows that art should be able to do whatever it wants from it, to get away from the wall and invade the whole space.</p>
<p>This starts a new trend of experimentation in art: starting from constraints, the artists push back and explore new possibilities (Sol Lewitt, Richard Serra, James Turrell, but also Joseph Beuys and La Monte Young in the world of performances).</p>
<p>More than simply a sculpture, an installation uses the whole space to integrate the body of the visitor.</p>

While we&#39;ve talked at length about how commercial art galleries contribute (somehow) to innovation and evolution in the art world, artist-run galleries are also a vital component of that eco-system, allowing for experimentations under a different paradigm than market dynamics.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>The activity of gallery is therefore not so much about educating the public about art and culture, but rather to move what makes up a part of art and culture in a particular direction (e.g. new artistic tendencies and movements). The role of digital media as we&#39;ve seen it so far in museums (educational) is less relevant in galleries, and therefore should be rethought.</p>
<p>It would either go in a completely profane direction (i.e. having not relationship to the art itself, but rather to the activity of the gallery), or integrated the &quot;sacred&quot; nature of the artwork (i.e. become an artwork itself).</p>
