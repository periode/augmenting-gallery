<p>Since there are no pre-requisites, students from other majors are also very welcomed, and contribute to a diversity of approaches and visions when it comes to designing information delivery in cultural contexts.</p>
<p>The link you see above should be consulted frequently, to get the latest information on the code, the schedule and the course notes. The class notes are generated from <a href="https://multimodal.cc">multimodal</a>, an ongoing research project on educational technology.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that is that taking notes on laptops inevitably lead to browsing the internet, and browsing the internet inevitably leads to the persons sitting next to you being distracted by what&#39;s happening on your screen, so please do not use laptops in class (outside of programming time), out of respect for your neighbour.</p>

<p>Museums present objects and artefacts that are both highly complex and acting as <em>proofs</em> for a certain narrative; galleries reorganize these artefacts to elicit artistic reflection and thought. Libraries develop an access to all: both on the physical (open doors) and intellectual level (librarians); finally, archives aim at gathering the largest amount of information and records for future analyses.</p>

<p>how does it relate to knowledge and archival?</p>
<ul>
<li>messaging</li>
<li>spotify, apple music</li>
<li>google maps (discovering new things on google maps, multiple options for the same itinerary, modes of transport, creates a sense of familiarity (but not with the city), focus on the app rather than the place, lose practice in orientation, ETA is wrong, decontextualizes the itinerary, if it&#39;s not on google maps, it doesn&#39;t exist)</li>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>As the media theorist Marshall McLuhan and computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum have respectively said, <em>media are extensions of man</em>, and <em>tools are projections of ourselves</em>.</p>
<p>The apps we use in our everyday lives have a particular impact on how we interact with the world and with society. Since no technology is intrinsically good or bad, we can rather think about what the <em>uses</em> of those apps are: when are they helpful? to whom? when are they not? what are the tradeoffs?</p>
<p>One thing to be remembered in terms of human-centered computer applications (e.g., the ones we use in our everyday lives), is that computers are supposed to <em>free time</em> for us to dispose with as we wish. Examining what we do with our free time is a correlate to using applications.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Maps are always an interface to the world, they are an <strong>abstraction</strong>, and abstractions are ways of thinking that allow us to remove unnecessary in order to get to the essence of a given thing. A map therefore abstracts the physical world, presenting a more understandable, but simpler version of our surroundings.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>if something doesn&#39;t exist on google maps, does it still exist?</li>
<li>if means of transportation are an abstraction of how to go from A to B, how about ways of transportation? being exposed to more or less pollution? taking a detour through a pedestrian street, or by a canal?</li>
</ul>
<p>These choices are made, but aren&#39;t always transparent, because some level of opacity is the necessary consequence of abstracting. If a story is a path through events, then Google Maps tells a very specific kind of story.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">website vs. mobile</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>ultimately, the web is a knowledge exchange network, but in fixed locations</p>
<p>smartphones put their own twist on this knowledge, by bringing computers (almost) everywhere</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>You might have heard the terms XR and MR a lot these days. They are both acronyms which refer to both Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). However similar these two technologies might seem, they exist on the very opposites of a spectrum.</p>
<p>VR and AR do share development workflow (AR and VR apps can usually be made with the same tools and programming languages), but they require drastically different design thiking. AR is about starting from the physical world and integrating the digital into it, while VR is about starting from the digital world (i.e. nothing) and rebuilding the physical world inside it.</p>
<p>This class is only going to focus on AR.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">broad questions</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>-&gt; what is overlooked/undocumented? how do we make it accessible?</p>
<p>-&gt; how do we organize information for a better understanding of something?</p>
<p>-&gt; what can a digital medium do that a print medium cannot?</p>
<p>-&gt; what difference does it make that it&#39;s in our pocket?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>To conclude our section introducting AR and digital applications, here are some broad questions that will guide our exploration of this medium throughout the semester.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Augmented Reality is about <strong>revealing information</strong>. This revealing of information always implies an abstraction: choosing to show thing A instead of thing B because you think it&#39;s important to focus on A. These choices need to be deliberate and thoughtful, taking into account what you want to do, and who you&#39;re doing it to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Augmented Reality is about <strong>opening up knowledge possibilities</strong>. With an interactive media, you&#39;re letting your users do things that they couldn&#39;t do before. What is it that you want them to be able to do, and what is the &quot;best&quot; way to do so? This question relates closely to UI and UX design.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Augmented Reality is about <em>reality</em>. By changing how we perceive reality, we also change how we perceive the world, and therefore ourselves. Each technology does that, and particularly information-processing technology, so there&#39;s no point in resisting it, but I believe it&#39;s important not to think in terms of hierarchies (more is always better), but rather in terms of what each of them give us and what each of them take from us.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;ll go over broad thoughts about what a museum is, how it is different from a gallery, and how we&#39;re going to be working with museums throughout the semester.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>We sometimes go to museums to learn about the history of a country, or of a trade, or of a theme. We can also go for temporary exhibitions or events. We can even go to get a coffee or a meal. Museums aim to be, as some would say today, &quot;platforms&quot;, they enable multiple kinds of activities through the layout of their infrastructure.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon why you go, and what you do in a museum is a good starting point when designing an application in the context of a museum. However, it shouldn&#39;t be the only perspective you think from. What about the team that works at a museum? What is their vision? What about a elementary school class visit? Why do they come? What about someone who&#39;s never been to a museum? Why would they want to come?</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Museums are cultural institutions, perhaps one of the most important cultural institutions in the western world. They have multiple roles: they display, preserve, educate, and connect. How they do each of these things, and how well they do it -that is up for debate.</p>
<p>There are two big differences museums and galleries: <strong>money</strong>, and <strong>time</strong>. Objects in a gallery are for sale, while objects in a museum aren&#39;t, and galleries mostyl deal with the present (what is being done), while museums mostly deal with the past (what has been done).</p>
<p>Galleries can also take multiple forms and shapes, like pop-up galleries, studio galleries, university galleries. They focus on the display of art works, while museums focus on the display of cultural works.</p>
<p>Particularly, this class will pay attention to the <strong>storytelling</strong> of museums: what kinds of stories, from which perspective, and to what end, are told by museums and galleries?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">making collections</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>museums present a <em>narrative</em> by presenting a network of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Museum <strong>spaces</strong> include navigation, locations, architecture, historical sites, surrounding areas, ...</p>
</li>
<li><p>Museum <strong>objects</strong> include the collection on display, the collection not on, display fixtures, temporary installations, ...</p>

<p>You will chose a particular use-case that they&#39;ve prepared for us, and design and develop a solution for it. Depending on the brief, the work might be more development-focused, or more design-focus.</p>
<p>In any case, during the final presentations, you should hand out both a design document and an AR prototype. The first visit by our partners will be on week 7 (see the <a href="https://github.com/periode/augmenting-gallery/wiki/Schedule">schedule</a> for more details).</p>
