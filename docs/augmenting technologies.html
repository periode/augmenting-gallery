Starting from there, we will trace the history of augmented reality until today.</p>
<p>What did they envision as they were just scratching the surface of what computers could do? How does this vision carry today? Can we, and should we try to change the direction in which these technologies are going?</p>
<p>The second part of the week will be a review of Unity, both on interfaces and programming, and then an introduction to development with XCode.</p>

Working on psychoacoustics, he realized that most of his time was taken up by monotonous, repetitive tasks, which could be automated by a computer. As director of the IPTO (1962-1964), he published memos outlining his vision for possible uses of computers to improve human lives.</p>
<p>One of the people he influenced was on Doug Engelbart, a Stanford researcher who founded the <em>Augmented Research Center</em>, particularly well known for presenting <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">the mother of all demos</a> (<a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ8ZiT1sn88">video</a>). Engelbart was also influenced by another thinker, Vanevar Bush, who wrote <a target='_blank' href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Licklider approaches the problem in terms of <strong>cooperation</strong>: what is it that we want to do? Do we want to solve math formulas, to pick a movie to watch, to invest money in different funds or to learn about a particular topic?</p>
<p>In order to answer these questions, he compares the strengths of humans and the strengths of machines and extrapolates on how they could work together. This <em>working together</em>, this collaboration, implies that the answer to the problem is not yet known. There is no clear information that needs to be delivered, but rather information that needs to be pieced together in order for the investigator (i.e. the learner) to create their own knowledge. Such an approach is in line with a pedagogical theory called <strong>constructivism</strong>, which we will talk more about in the week about museums and education.</p>
<p>This particular reading is interesting in how he lists out the practical obstacles of reaching such a collaboration (speed, language, and Input/Output). Out of those three obstacles, two of them have been overcome a long time ago. It&#39;s only the language part that is the problem. So now that we are close to having gotten rid of big technical hurdles, what are the non-technical hurdles left?</p>

</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Succeeding Licklider, Sutherland, is thinking of computers in more precise terms as how they can apply in a practical use case. If Licklider was thinking of broad concepts, Sutherland narrowed them down with specific <em>inventions</em>, and shows the transition between thinking and doing.</p>
<p>Sutherland developed the first touchscreen, called <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wrn9cxlgls">Sketchpad</a> as his masters thesis, and then one of the first VR headsets, called the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVUgfUvP4uk">Sword of Damocles</a>. Later, he transferred at the University of Utah where he oversaw the development of the <code>Smalltalk</code> computer language, as well as some of the foundational work in computers graphics (one of his mentees, Ed Catmull, ended up creating the Pixar animation studios).</p>
<p>More than just about improving the finding of questions and answers, Sutherland worked on the practical tools which could enable us to develop such ideas in a concrete way.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the ultimate display</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>displays adds spatiality as a way to <strong>reveal</strong> information (making visible an object), and to <strong>lay out</strong> information (making visible the relationship of objects) and to <strong>manipulate</strong> information (changing it in real-time to observe its behaviour).</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/VisiCalc.jpg" alt="VisiCalc.jpg"></div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>as input/output devices, displays are inscribed within a broader effort to use more senses (physical, visual, aural, olfactive, etc.) as a means to communicate a message.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>While Sutherland is focused on the wonderland of mathematics, it is interesting to see how he considers the display: not just as a means to show information, but also as a means to <strong>manipulate</strong> it. By using computer processing power, we don&#39;t need to type in every single command as written text, it should be possible to imagine a system in which the interaction is as <em>intuitive</em> as possible, while interacting with objects that are not, at first, intuitive at all (e.g. the Catmull spline).</p>
<p>As visual appendices, displays are also means to expand the range of our interactions. While the first means of interaction was purely mechanically written (i.e. typographical), having a spatial display now allows us to organize information in a non-linear fashion. Similarly to how Sutherland talks about kinesthetic displays, we could potentially think of olfactive displays, or kinetic displays—essentially vibrating smartphones and game controllers.</p>
<p>Slightly tangentially, there is <a target='_blank' href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190226-how-your-language-reflects-the-senses-you-use">some evidence</a> that a &quot;visual-first approach&quot; is actually somewhat dependent on the fact that Western linguistic cultures are visual cultures, moreso than non-Western linguistic cultures which, such as Farsi or Cantonese, have a richer vocabulary when it comes to tasting things. Additionally, visual cues are not as good as olfactive cues (smells) when it comes to helping memory.</p>
<p>Displays allow us to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>see-through matter: seeing two things at the same time</p>
</li>
<li><p>involve all human senses</p>
</li>

Mounted on braces, it used physical rotation tilt in order to calculate where in space it was looking at, overlaying content in order to make it seem like it belonged to the world itself. More than a <em>product</em>, it was more of a research endeavour, a proof of concept. As it goes with most technologies, there first needs to be a long period of research and development before practical applications are found.</p>
<p>Similarly, Myron Krueger worked on &quot;Augmented Environments&quot;, room-scale installations which involved participants&#39; whole bodies, combining video streams as means of communication and interaction between two individuals. His research was more focused on the artistic and emotional implications of new display technologies, which in turn influenced the field of interactive installations and digital art.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, more practical applications started to appear. The Virtual Fixtures project was developed by the US Air Force to facilitate the work of tele-operators, for example in guiding vehicles through complicated terrain. In the civil domain, KARMA was a project from Columbia University which used graphics overlays to facilitate the understanding of the inside of an object, to facilitate maintenance, repairs and upgrades.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The popularity of AR comes with its introduction in the commercial field, starting with the print industry, which has the advantage of being able to print out anything on a paper surface—at the time, AR technology could only recognize very specifc images, called <em>markers</em> or <em>trackers</em>. At this moment in time, a magazine cover is the ideal medium to support this approach. The intent is to investigate both the entertainment value (Esquire) as well as the consumer benefit (BMW).</p>
<p>Between 2013 and 2016, Google unveils both the Google Glass, a compact pair of glasses featuring a small screen, effectively allowing a digital overlay on the world and an almost seamless integration, but was over-estimating the willingness of their customers to adopt this kind of wearable technology. On the other side, the massive success of Pokemon Go came from a more conservative approach, rebooting a popular franchise, along with an already existing community (the Google-owned developer, Niantic Labs, had already been successfully running a game called Ingress) and an existing infrastructure (the Google Maps database). Pokemon Go reached up to 45million daily users at its peak.</p>

</ul>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">solving problems</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>the three main problems in the adoption of AR (and of any technology, for that matter) are</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> hardware performance and affordability</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> relevant content</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> user experience.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><ul>
<li>performance and affordability is steadily getting there</li>
<li>content might be adapted</li>
<li>user experience must be adapted and refined, through <a target='_blank' href="https://newmedia.fandom.com/wiki/Remediation">remediation</a></li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>While hardware performance has, thanks to Moore&#39;s law, almost been overcome, the other two obstacles are a little more complicated.</p>
<p>Relevant content involves understanding the relevance of the medium, something we discuss more in week 3. What kind of storyteliing fits a spatial display? There is a need to identify the specificities of AR, and integrate them within the content itself (e.g. there is a difference between a theater play and a movie, between a book and a newspaper, between an album and a DJ mix).</p>
<p>User experience focuses on the way users will <em>interact</em> with these new systems. Are the existing heuristics (e.g. swipe, tap) the best way one can input something into the system? What about device orientation? Should the content projected on the ground be the same as the one projected on the wall?</p>
<p>Relevant content creation and user experience design are two of the areas which shouldn&#39;t be understimated by AR designers.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">today's applications</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>there are multiple kinds of AR</p>
<p>using <strong>hardware</strong> (projection mapping, static display, hand-held, mechanical bearings)</p>
<p>switching to <strong>software</strong> (using a combination of AI and gyroscope to fit in a hand held).</p>
<p>applications range across military, medicine, entertainment, education, transportation.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Again, we&#39;ve narrowed down the obstacles, by using machine learning and computer vision to analyze and recognize the environment (software solution), along with better inegrated gyroscopes, accelerometers and GPS systems.</p>
<p>The computing of graphics still has to happen on the device itself as of today, so it is still limited, but that could be solved by large-scale 5G network implementation (an approach which includes potential health hazards) and having remote processing of the environment.</p>
<p>While the phone-based version of AR can still improve in terms of interaction paradigms, making further use of the gyroscope to integrate the device orientation, hand-held based systems are focusing more on a gesture-based UI.</p>

We&#39;re less sure about the creation of meaning than about the way differential equations work, so in a lot of computer-aided applications, the problem is still to formulate exactly what the problem is. &quot;<em>I would like to see all that is relevant to the current task at hand</em>&quot; is too vague of a query for a computer to fulfill, and is a field that is still currently being worked on, particularly in the realm of personal assistants (e.g. Siri, Alexa, etc.). It&#39;s therefore still the task of the designer and developer to try to anticipate, accomodate, and encourage anything that their user might think about or attempt to do.</p>
<p>On the other side, the interesting switch is that the vision of Sutherland realized in sort of a negative fashion: it&#39;s not the room that has become a whole display, but the display that has been concentrated so much that it almost matches our gaze itself. Our phone sees what we see, and therefore become an extension of our eye. One significant implication of this is that AR is moving towards the individual, the subjective, rather than towards the shared, subjective.</p>

The following question, then, is <strong>what do we do with the time we&#39;ve gained?</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, searching through datasets in a library can result in more time dedicated to actual thinking about how those resources relate to us. Automatic formatting on a word processor allows us to take more time to think about the content.</p>
<p>In the end, taking care of formal details actually helps us narrow down what it is that we&#39;re doing, and even asking <em>why</em> we&#39;re going it.</p>

The moment at which this becomes easier is when existing ways of doing prove obviously uneffective; for instance, the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) is of limited use in AR, and therefore needs a re-thinking. As a corollary, the decisions we make today will influence what people will do in the future.</p>
<p>Rethinking one part of a system (here, its input), can also push us to rethink other aspects, such as its purpose, its audience, its output, etc.</p>

In terms of innovation, the most far-fetched ideas often do not end up being widely adopted as is, but will influence heavily the further design of other applications.</p>
<p>The term <em>speculative design</em>, popularized by <a target='_blank' href="http://www.designinginteractions.com/interviews/DunneandRaby">Dunne and Raby</a> is the process of inventing applications which might not have an immediate use in the world as we know it today, but instead suggest a world in which such applications would become common place (i.e. designing an application for tracking individual CO2 emissions, or for deciding on which budget will tax money be spent on, or for checking on the mood of one&#39;s home assistant, etc.). In terms of museum design, it could be an app in which all museum users connected to the museum&#39;s WiFi network could chat and exchange comments on any artwork.</p>
