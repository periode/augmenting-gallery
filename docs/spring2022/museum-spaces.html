</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The first role of the museum is to <em>preserve</em>: that is, to archive and keep in ideal condition things that seem interesting to the collector. Reasons why an object might be deemed interesting can include: being part of a foreign culture, being part of a foreign time, being an unusual manifestation of a usually common object (e.g. cabinet of wonders).</p>
<p>The act of choosing that object already makes it interesting, and changes the semantic (meaningful) load onto that object.</p>
<p>The reason can be political, symbolical, technical, aesthetic, etc.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the museum as education</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>ways of communicating include <strong>exposure</strong>, <strong>explanation</strong> and <strong>duplication</strong>. (both for amateurs and professionals)</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Once the artefact is chosen, and once it is shown to the public, the implicit question is &quot;<em>why</em>&quot;. The reason why is that those objects, by virtue of being &quot;originals&quot;, stand as powerful representations of a bigger concept (a culture, a time, a place, a style, etc.). As a curator or designer, what you should keep in mind are those <em>absent facts</em>, those things that the object stands in for.</p>
<p>Because these absent facts aren&#39;t immediately available, they need to be communicated. This communication can happen either by having the public confronted with the object, and the object only (exposure); it can happen by providing material and individuals who will guide the interpretation of the public (explanation); it can happen by providing the public with copies of the object that they can make their own and appreciate in different environments and under different lights.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The more recent developments of museum studies is a consequence of the rejection of the &quot;<em>monolithic narrative</em>&quot;.

</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>the history between museums and buildings traces ranges from the political (the Louvre), to the artistic (the Guggenheim) and the functional (the Tate Modern).</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>In terms of architecture, museum buildings exist along a gradient between the <strong>political</strong>, the <strong>artistic</strong> and the <strong>functional</strong>.</p>
<p>The political highlights the socailly representative nature of the building, and therefore of the museum. The Louvre, former royal palace opened up to the public after the revolution, is an example in one direction, while the Uffizi galleries in Florence represent the wealth and taste of the ruling Medici family.</p>
<p>The artistic focuses on the building as a work of art in itself, usually designed by a leading architecture agency. The relationship is no longer to the objects, but to the new display of financial and cultural influence by states and companies. Examples of these include the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, the Louis Vuitton Foundation, or the Prada Foundation.</p>
<p>Finally, the functional is the latest stage in museum architecture, in which the spatial organization is second not to political statement, not to artistic display, but to the presentation and communication of the museum itself as a pedagogical and research institutions. Such buildings include the Dia Foundation, the Massachussetts Museum of Contemporary Art, or the Centre Pompidou.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">reflective space</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p><em>reflective space</em> is one in which the linear dimension of the museum space reflects the linear dimension of the knowledge delivery.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/tatemodern.jpg" alt="tatemodern.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The first type of space that muesums exhibit are <em>reflective</em> spaces, in which the physical building reinforces the paradigm under which the museum operates. In most cases, such paradigms can be the linear development of time in art history, the grouping of formally similar artists together, and the separation by geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>The picture here is from the Tate Gallery in London, and the perspective offered to you here hints at a &quot;<em>pearl necklace</em>&quot; layout, in which each small room is connected to the others by a single pathway in, and a single pathway out. The flow of the public is therefore heavily constrained, and implies a strict order in which to approach the collection.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">descriptive space</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>descriptive space is, on the opposite, multi-dimensional. it leaves agency to the visitor to compose their own path, and assemble their own perspectives.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/diabeacon.jpg" alt="diabeacon.jpg"></div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/nationalgalerie.png" alt="nationalgalerie.png"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>As a counterpoint to linear space, <em>descriptive</em> space is a space in which the objects of display are laid out such that they can be approached from different perspectives, and in different orders.</p>
<p>The itinirerary of the visitor is in this case a little less pre-determined, and the appreciation of the objects can be made on the visitor&#39;s own terms. However, studies have shown that such a descriptive approach has led to visitors spending less time per object, but viewing more objects altogether when compared with visits within <em>reflective</em> spaces.</p>
<p>The top picture is from Dia:beacon in upstate NY, and the bottom one is the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. Both of these spaces contrast with spaces like the Tate, above, in that they immediately suggest multiple paths to explore the collection.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">social space</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>along with being <em>informational</em>, spaces are also <em>social</em>. there are points of encounter where the focus isn&#39;t getting to know something else, but getting to know someone else.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/hkw_atrium.jpg" alt="hkw_atrium.jpg"></div><div class="prep" concept="2"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/courmarly.jpg" alt="courmarly.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Finally, the latest developments in museum studies have shifted the focus on the development of <strong>social spaces</strong>. The museum hall, courtyard or park then becomes a deliberate social hub, in which communities meet each other, rather than exclusively interacting with inanimate objects.</p>
<p>These two pictures illustrate some of these spaces. The first is the atrium of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin, a neutral space which can be re-purposed as a welcoming grounds for different sorts of events and exhibitions. The second is the Cour Marly at the Louvre, taking advantadge of the existing architecture to become a movement hub, with visitors being exposed to each other more with greater intensity than in individual galleries.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">question</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>where is an object located? is it in a more social space? or in a more informational space?</p>
<p>should you assume the visitors are alone, or surrounded by crowds?</p>
<p>has the visitor followed a specific path up until that object, or was it a free-association?</p>
<p><strong>what could be the pros and cons of each (informational, alone vs. social, in group)?</strong></p>

<p>it&#39;s the craft of translating the <em>why</em> of museology into the <em>how</em> of the exhibition.</p>
<p>it involves spacing, hanging, lighting and delimiting.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>While buildings themselves create a spatial influence, another influence is <strong>the layout of objects within that space</strong>. We&#39;ll see how those are affected by the <em>groupings</em> of objects, their <em>spacing</em> and the relationship of those objects with the building itself.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>Grouping objects together gives them a different dimension, by the sheer effect of <strong>juxtaposition</strong>; not unlike a charade, multiple objects together form a sort of a charade that needs to be solved by the visitor (that charade might be more or less hard to solve).</p>
<p>In terms of spacing, the breathing room left around these objects, and the way they are hung tell us a lot about their status. The first example is the fabiola exhibition at the national portrait gallery, focusing on the subtle differences as markers of identity and unicity within a greater, homogeneous culture.</p>
<p>The second example is the Mona Lisa at the Louvre. The altar-like structure and the separation from both the audience and the rest of the collection is a testimony to the god-like status of the piece within the museum and tourism industry.</p>
<p>The last example is an exhibition designed by a De Stijl member, Frederick Kiesler, who focuses on the removal of the limits between works and public, and lets the canvases hang, within reach of the visitors&#39; hands.</p>
<p>other categories to present collections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>materials</li>

<p>The <strong>social</strong> context is the group (or lack of group) that they are visitors are with. Small social circle of friends? Tourist group? Private tour?</p>

<p>there are as many differences between buildings and software as their are similarities.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="5"><p>This definition could apply both to physical and virtual architectures. We&#39;ll see in this section that architecture is a useful way to think of the environment in which our message is delivered. How do components and relations highlight an overarching principle? The <em>organization of the environment</em>, whether built or informational, is the common point here.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">buildings as states and flows</h3><div class="prep" concept="5"><p>architecture can be envisioned both as concrete <strong>states</strong> (walls, roofs, bricks, etc.), but also as <strong>flows</strong> and possibilities (walkways, platforms, mezzanines, etc.)</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="5"><p>The first image represents the floorplan of the <em>Canada Museum of Nature</em>, and it is unclear what spaces mean besides their immediate functionality (stairs, bathrooms). From looking at this only, one cannot tell which room is the most attractive, where do visitors spend most of their time, what is the gauge capacity (max. people in a room) and what are the connections between each room.</p>
<p>The second image represents the same museum, but in terms of user flows. The spaces are represented both by their practical function, but also by their roles. They are connected to one another and help us form a mental map of the possibilities offered to each visitors to craft their relatively personal tour.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">software as states and flows</h3><div class="prep" concept="5"><p>similarly, software can be approached by from the <em>hard</em> aspect, or the <em>soft</em> aspect.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="5"><p>Similarly, software architecture can denote very dry technical diagrams (such as the first image) or rather represent an application in terms of possibilities of navigation offered to the user. During the development of your app, you should focus rather on the second approach: what matters is <em>what can the user see and do</em>.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">similarities</h3><div class="prep" concept="5"><p>-&gt; <em>components</em></p>
<p>in buildings, components can be <em>rooms</em> or <em>plazas</em>. in software, they&#39;re <em>scenes</em>, or <em>views</em>.</p>
<p>-&gt; <em>relations</em></p>
<p>in buildings, relations can be <em>lines of sight</em>, <em>hallways</em>, or <em>doors</em>. in software, they&#39;re <em>hyperlinks</em>, or <em>buttons</em>, <em>previews</em>.</p>
<p>-&gt; <em>principle</em></p>
<p>in buildings, principles can be <em>linear</em>, <em>grid-like</em> or <em>radial</em>. in software, they&#39;re <em>single-page applications</em>, <em>endless scroll</em>, <em>gyroscope-based</em>.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="5"><p>Unity Scenes are the building blocks of your app, and they should be as necessary and as meaningful as a real, brick and mortar room. Each room should have a clear purpose, while leaving some room (no pun intended) to the user to possibly explore the content wihtin that room at their own pace.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>relations</em>, links and buttons do not quite match with hallways, doors and thresholds, because one cannot naturally &quot;see&quot; where the button leads to. Digital design principles such as preview, peek, new-tab are ways that digital designers have tried to develop to counter this inherent limitation of visibility.</p>
