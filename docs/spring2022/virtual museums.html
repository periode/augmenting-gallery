</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>against making copies?</p>
<p><strong>before</strong> (15th century), it used to depreciate the value of a work based on specific workshops.</p>
<p><strong>today</strong> (16th century onwards), it depreciates the value of a work based on names and tradition.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/vasari.jpg" alt="vasari.jpg"></div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>(meanwhile, moxie 模写 relies on &#39;transmission by copying&#39; )</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>what changed with photography?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Making copies has been frowned upon in Western art history ever since the figure of the artist as solitary creator has emerged. This appearance is marked in part by Giorgio Vasari&#39;s opus: <em>The Lives of the Artists</em>, in which he depicts the biographies of the artists of his time, essentially giving them a specific status. That status was based on &quot;uniqueness&quot;, as opposed to only &quot;skill&quot;.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Vasari is also the one who orchestrated the construction and design of the Uffizi palaces, one of the first modern museums. What happened then, is the separation of the artist from the artesan: the former working on unique pieces, while the latter was working on generic designs. The mastery of skill, along with new storytellers like Vasari led to the emergence of the artist as a lone genius. Created by such an artist, the artwork also acquires unique aspects.</p>
<p>Today, museums are built around the core idea of preservation: that there is one original which needs to be safeguarded, because it has lived through history, and perhaps bears its marks. The assumption is that, without this original component of tradition, there would be no following pieces, and no tradition.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the age of reproduction</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>this question acquires a new dimension in the context of chemical reproduction (photo, film), and then digital reproduction.</p>

</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Benjamin talks about the change in our conception of the art object that is brought about by reproduction technologies. Considering the relationship between the original and the copy, he assigns to the original the <em>aura</em>, the sum of historical events that have left a mark on the materiality of that object. This is what copies do not and will never possess. However, he also considers the aura as a means to sustain a fascination for the past/tradition. In that sense, he considers such a reverence for the original object a potential pathway to fascist behaviour (the text itself was written in 1934 as an address to the Institute for the Study of Fascism).</p>
<p>His answer is to offer reproduction as a means to include the broadest public in the appreciation and appropriation of art. He suggests that distributing copies, and allowing any individual to be featured in reproducible materials (i.e. amateur photographs and amateur films), is a necessity for anti-fascistic democratic behavior.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Activating an artwork is an integral part of what the work is actually <em>about</em>, which means that the <strong>aura</strong> of the original has to be intepreted as a complex web of historical dynamics, rather than as a simple, ephemeral object. The personal interpretation and appropriation of an artwork is what he calls <strong>implementation</strong>, and it is essential to the survival of said artwork.</p>

<p>two problems, though:</p>
<p>-&gt; inaccuracy of digital reproduction</p>
<p>-&gt; unequal technical skills reveal a lack of clear intent</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>There were high hopes from the use of online technology for museums. At the same time, the Web 2.0 had started to appear: that is, a web that is no longer static, but collaborative, in which anyone can create, post, and share (e.g. MySpace, Tumblr). Therefore, the visitors started to have different expectations of museums websites and the museums themselves offered solutions.</p>
<p>One of the first problem they encountered was that the digital copies, improved through 2D or 3D rendering, developed a false sense of what was actually scientifcally known (e.g. reconstruction of pieces, close-ups of materials, etc.). It was therefore morally dubious to present these as artefacts from which research could be based on, instead of the originals.</p>
<p>The second problem was that they realized that only a small fraction of their public actually had the skills necessary (both technically and conceptually) to take full advantage of the resources shared by the museum. It was therefore necessary to develop different approaches to a purely scientific database.</p>

Additionally, they allow us to highlight some of the assumptions built into this technology in order to better understand what this infrastructure was made for in the first place, and what kind of worldview it implicitly conveys.</p>
<p>For instance, The Sims 3 has an architecture that is built around the programming paradigm of Object-Orientation. This means that the true actors in the game are not the Sims themselves, but rather the objects that surround the sims. The bed, the bathroom and the TV all broadcast invisible signals to compete for the attention of the passive Sims. Such an architecture reveals the highly materialistic value set of the game series.

Does it need to try to reproduce something that existed previously, or does it re-appropriate it to update it to serve its own needs?</p>
<p>On the one hand, this example from the British Museum in 2011 shows how the online component of museums highlights the sense of &quot;placelessness&quot; of modern museum. Similarly to science labs, it advertises &quot;the universality and authority of the culture that builds and inhabits them&quot;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, by building upon the existing commercial infrastructure of web platforms and webshops, the museum cannot avoid being presented, to some extent, as a marketplace, failing to convey the idea of the <em>art</em> catalogue as opposed to the <em>sales</em> catalogue.</p>

</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Another approach from the catalogue one is to try to render as straightforwardly as possible. That is, re-creating the visitor experience in a browser, by using techniques such as 360 photo, video, and photogrammetry. While it might seem straightforward, such an approach might also have some heavy influences, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>the &quot;on-rails&quot; aspect the experience (following a set path)</li>
<li>the limited embodiment of &quot;one-perspective&quot;</li>

<p>-&gt; understanding the technical and social frameworks for browsing (mobile)</p>
<p>-&gt; relying on and promoting the use of interconnectivity (APIs, hyperlinks)</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><div>Acknowledging the different nature of digital as a medium, museal institutions have approached the problem by starting with the medium, highlighting the **contributive aspect** (New Palmyra and the crowdsourcing of disappeared monuments), the **device-specific** aspect (Uffizi and their mobile navigation) and finally the **connection** aspect (BVH, Europeana).

The important points here is to understand that an online presence:
- comes with a set of expectations on how to interact with it
- comes with a distinct visual language, to which the archival language is not always suited
- comes with a whole range of possibilities by interconnecting systems

Regarding the last point, APIs are a digital protocol which allows two systems to interface (essentially by agreeing on communication). This allows different servers to receive and broadcast information, potentially ending up in aggregating content from different providers, such as the BVH, or by acting as a source of content, such as Europeana.</div></div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">conclusion</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>Museums have operated a slow switch from a blunt dump of information/basic visiting information to the attempt to recreate and enhance the museum visit.</p>

Both of these techniques have been deployed throughout more and more institutions, and are starting to inform digital decisions of museums. Amongst some of the results, professionals have discovered that they have three different kinds of users:</p>
<ol>
<li>professional (skillset, knowledge, professional reasons) (25%)</li>
<li>hobbyist (skillset, knowledge, personal reasons) (25%)</li>
<li>novice (no skillset, personal reasons) (50%)</li>
</ol>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">specialized publics</h3><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>only 3% of users regularly used a museum&#39;s collection; it&#39;s a highly restricted, highly skilled group of professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>most museums have developed their own structures (e.g. based on shared protocols) to accomodate these publics and their creations of <strong>folksonomies</strong>.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>While the professionals know what they want, and know how to get it, hobbyists also represent an essential pool of resources. By tagging and commenting on artworks, they can improve the quality of the archives, through a process called <strong>folksonomy</strong>, essentially combining the floating-ness of folk knowledge with the rigor of scientific taxonomies.</p>
<p>Integrating those hobbyists illustrate the benefit of having an open collection (open in the technical and practical sense).</p>

One of the latest and most massive shift has been the turn away from intrinsic communication (from the museum world to the museum-goers) and towards extrinsic communication (from the museum towards the rest of the world).</p>
<p>The immediate consequence of that is the entrance of museums into the world of social media; they started creating youtube channels, instagram accounts, twitter hashtags, etc. in order to reach where their audience already is, and in a language they can talk to.</p>
<p>the biggest barrier to entry is still the lack of familiarity with the search process, both technical (how?) and conceptual (why?).</p>
