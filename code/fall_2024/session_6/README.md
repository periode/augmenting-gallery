# React base project

This is a basic React template.

All files that you want to modify are in the `src/`.

- `.jsx` files are the react files, they always have the following structure:

```js
function MyComponentName() {
    
    return(<>

    </>)
}

export default MyComponentName;
```

Take a look at [`src/components/Photo.jsx`](src/components/Photo.jsx) for the example of a component.
