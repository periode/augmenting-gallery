# Adding a map to our app

The library we use to add a map is called [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), and we use it in react via [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/).

Start by installing all of the required packages: `npm install leaflet react-leaflet`

Then follow the [Preparing your page](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) section, by adding the CSS and JS in your `app.html`, and the CSS rules in `index.css`:

```css
.leaflet-container {
  height: 100%;
}
```

Finally, you can use your map, as in the `App.js` file!
